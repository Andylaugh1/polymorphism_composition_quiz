Polymorphism
What does the word 'polymorphism' mean?
- Polymorphism is from Greek words "Poly" and "Morphism" which mean "many" and "forms" respectively.
Therefore it means to be able to take on multiple forms in different situations.

What does it mean when we apply polymorphism to OO design? Give a simple Java example.
- An example of polymorphism would be an object acting as two different types of object in two different settings.
 - for example a printer object can be a printer, and at the same be simply a 'device' in an array of devices
 - Methods can also be polymorphic and two versions of the same methods can be used on the same class

What can we use to implement polymorphism in Java?
- We can use classes, interfaces and arrays.

How many 'forms' can an object take when using polymorphism?
- It can take many forms. There is not a specific limit.

Give an example of when you could use polymorphism.



Composition
What do we mean by 'composition' in reference to object-oriented programming?
- Composition references an object, or class, which is composed, or partially composed, of other objects.

When would you use composition? Provide a simple example in Java.
- You may use composition when creating a car object - as the car object may be composed (made up of) of properties which themselves are objects. Eg an engine object, tyre objects,

What is/are the advantage(s) of using composition?
- The advantage of using composition is that often is can add simplicity to a project and reduce the need for lots of inheritance.

What happens to the behaviours when the object composed of them is destroyed?
- They are lost too
